# Circular-Calendar
Computer Science Internal Assessment M23

## Introduction
This project is a circular calendar, which was designed for a client as part of IB Computer Science. It was built using JavaFX, with UI development in FXML. The calendar displays events in a circular format, and interfaces with a remote SQLite database. Using Gluon Mobile, this could be ported to other devices (which was key to why JavaFX was chosen). 

A video demonstration was produced of the project, and is attached below. 

The calendar implements recurring events and a weekly report, as well as the adding and removing of single events.
